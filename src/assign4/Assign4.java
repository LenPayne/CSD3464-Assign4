     * Exercise #1 - Sum of All Numbers

     * Write a program that asks the user for a positive nonzero integer 
     * value less than 1000. The program should use a loop to find the sum of 
     * adding the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example, if 
     * the user enters 90, the loop will find the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 89 + 90.

     * Sample Output:
     * ==============
     * 
     *   Enter a positive, nonzero integer value less than 1000:

     *   The sum of integers up to 90 is 4095.

     * Exercise #2 - Distance Traveled File
     * 
     * The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
     *     Distance = Speed * Time
     * For example, if a train travels 40 miles-per-hour for three hours, the 
     * distance traveled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks for the speed 
     * of a vehicle (in miles-per-hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. 
     * It should use a loop to display the distance a vehicle has traveled for 
     * each hour of a time period specified by the user. For example, if a 
     * vehicle is traveling at 40mph for a three-hour time period, it should 
     * output a report similar to the one that follows to a file named 
     * "ex3output.txt":
     * 
     * ex3output.txt:
     * ==============
     *   Hour    Distance Traveled
     *   -------------------------
     *   1               40
     *   2               80
     *   3              120
     * 
     * Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not 
     * accept any value less than 1 for time traveled.

     * Exercise 3 - Largest and Smallest
     * 
     * Write a program with a loop that lets the user enter a series of 
     * integers. The user should enter -99 to signal the end of the series. 
     * After all the numbers have been entered, the program should display the 
     * largest and smallest numbers entered.

     * To pass the unit tests, your final two lines of output must match the pattern:
     * Smallest number is x.
     * Largest number is y.

     * Sample Output:
     * ==============

     * converting a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
     *     F = (9.0/5.0) * C + 32
